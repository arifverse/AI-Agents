# PutawayHelper Agent

## Overview

PutawayHelper is a React-based interactive application designed for distribution centers (DCs). It helps putaway drivers and material handlers visualize and optimize their daily putaway tasks, making warehouse operations more efficient.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Putaway List** – Displays up to 10 putaway tasks with item names and locations.
2. **Distance-Based Sorting** – Prioritizes putaways in the current aisle and sorts remaining tasks by proximity to the putaway driver's current location.
3. **Current Location Tracking** – Updates the driver’s location after completing each task.
4. **Distribution Center Map**:

   * Visual grid representing 10 aisles and 15 slots per aisle.
   * Highlights the putaway driver's current location and remaining putaway tasks.
5. **Interactive Controls** – Users can mark tasks as complete, which updates the driver’s location and reorders remaining tasks.

## User Interface

* **Left Panel: Order of Putaways**

  * Lists putaway tasks.
  * Displays `Aisle` and `Slot` coordinates.
  * Shows distance from the current location.
  * `Complete` button to mark a task as done.

* **Right Panel: Distribution Center Map**

  * Grid representing aisles and slots.
  * Highlights current location and remaining putaway tasks.

## Requirements

* React (v16.8+ for Hooks)
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* Modern browser support

## Functional Requirements

1. Putaway driver starts at `Aisle 1, Slot 1`.
2. Initial putaway list contains 10 tasks randomly assigned to aisles and slots.
3. Tasks in the current aisle are prioritized, then sorted by distance.
4. Completing a putaway task updates the driver’s location and re-sorts remaining tasks.
5. Map displays driver location, task positions, and numbered aisles and slots.

## Visual Requirements

* Highlight the putaway driver's current location in green.
* Highlight remaining putaway tasks in blue.
* Display order of putaways clearly on the left panel.
* Map scales correctly for 10 aisles x 15 slots.

## Assumptions

* Putaway driver can enter/exit aisles only from the leftmost or rightmost slots.
* Distance calculation considers horizontal movement along slots and vertical movement along aisles.
* DC layout is static with no obstacles besides aisles and slots.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Start the development server: `npm start`.
4. Open a browser at `http://localhost:3000` to interact with PutawayHelper.
